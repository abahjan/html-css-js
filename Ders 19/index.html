             <h1>loudly cheers</h1>
             <h1>We’re the blue and claret supporters</h1>
             <h1>It matters not where we hail from</h1>
Whether it's the south or the north
Now we all agree, we all agree,
One flag unites us in brotherhood. 
Blue and claret blowing in the wind
One valiant cry
We’ve got a name that everyone knows: 
Barça, Barça, Baaarça!

Players, Supporters
United we are strong.
We’ve achieved much over the years,
We’ve shouted many goals
And we have shown, we have shown,
That no one can ever break us.
Blue and claret blowing in the wind
One valiant cry
We’ve got a name that everyone knows:
Barça, Barça, Baaarça!
